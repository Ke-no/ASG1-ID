# Design Process
As a UI/UX Designer, I will be focusing on simplifying the website, making it more classical, clean and UI friendly. The first step in revamping the website is to create a wireframe for my client to see and visualize the end product. Client also wanted to sell more products to their audiences by notifying them beforehand through pre-orders, so everyone will get a chance in purchasing their desired product.
